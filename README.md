# Try-C Website

## UI-Basics Project

### Technologies used

-   HTML5
-   CSS3
-   SaSS

**Techniques lerned/used**  
linear-gradient for colored picture backgrounds  
The flex property was very usefull to build this website, making easy to work with responsiveness.  
_transform: scale_ for pictures
Sketching the webpage in a paper before writing the code was very usefull to know exactly how to structure the divisions.  
Learning how to work in a project with many people using github was a very nice thing. Github is an amazing and powerful platform but sometimes can be a bit hard to use when you are not used to it. In this project github got way more clear to me.

**Main Struggles**  
Integrating background images & colors at the same time  
Making the website responsive  
Working on Github with other people and merging  
pushing and pulling revised code (resolving conflicts)  
So far the most difficult thing for me was positioning the images and show the exact content of the image to be displayed.
