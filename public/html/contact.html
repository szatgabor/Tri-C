        <h3>FREQUENTLY ASKED QUESTIONS</h3>
        <p>HOW WILL I GET MY CME CERTIFICATE / POINTS?</p>
        <p>
          Your certificate will be issued once you have completed your course
          evaluation form at the end of the course.
        </p>

        <p>WHAT EQUIPMENT WILL BE USED DURING A COURSE?</p>
        <p>
          The equipment used will depend on the nature of the course. Some
          courses are lecture based and some more practical. Please see the
          individual course details for further information.
        </p>

        <p>CAN I PAY FOR MY COURSE ONLINE?</p>
        <p>
          We are currently working on our online payment system which will be up
          and running very soon. In the meantime, cheque and bank transfer
          payments are accepted. All the details can be found on the invoice
          that will be emailed to you once you have registered your details for
          the course.
        </p>

        <p>
          WILL I GET A REFUND IF THE COURSE I HAVE REGISTERED FOR IS CANCELLED?
        </p>
        <p>
          If the course you have registered for is cancelled, we will speak with
          you to see if there are any other courses that you are interested in.
          If the course is rescheduled we will list you onto the next available
          date. If you are unable to attend any of the upcoming dates or courses
          we will refund the course fees to you.
        </p>

        <p>I HAVE PAID TO ATTEND A COURSE BUT I AM UNABLE TO ATTEND</p>
        <p>
          Our schedules and planning of courses is based on the people
          attending. If you are unable to attend a course and advise us with a
          minimum of two weeks’ notice we will issue you with a credit note that
          can be used for future courses. Any notice less than 2 weeks but more
          than 1 week would result in a credit note at 50% of the value paid.
          Any less than a week would mean no credit note would be issued if you
          are unable to attend.
        </p>

        <p>
          IF I HAVE REGISTERED MY DETAILS FOR A COURSE AM I A CONFIRMED
          ATTENDEE?
        </p>
        <p>
          Your place on the course will be confirmed once payment for the course
          has been received.
        </p>

        <p>WHERE CAN I SEE MY COURSE HISTORY?</p>
        <p>
          Your course history can be viewed by logging into your account using
          the details you entered when you registered for your first course.
